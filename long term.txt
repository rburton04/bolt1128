Long term ideas to add to BOLT:

Complete building the general steps
Complete building the selenium actions
Way to connect/read data from a DB for testing
Enhance Gauge default reporting
Add support for other ways to run selenium (aka localy, grid, browserstack, etc.)
Build in browsermob to handle proxies if needed? (doesn't work with grid)
Handling positive and negative test cases through a data-driven method
Separate report for automation "health" to ensure it remains heathly and running as efficiently as possible
Validate downloads/generated documents/reports
Automate desktop applications (needs investigation, possibly use Sikuli)
Integrate performance testing
Support mobile testing (investigate usage of Appium, Selendroid, calabash)
Integrate system monitoring (needs investigation)
Integrate with Atlassian (or similar) for automated bug reporting (that would need to be reviewed by QA first, but could speed up the process)
Run headless for faster execution
Incorperates tags for organizing tests. Could be used for marking a limited number of tests to run against every pr to find bugs earlier
